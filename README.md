# What is this?
Here you can find the config files I use for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Installation
============
Put cfg files here: Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg  
Put radiopanel.txt here: Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource\ui

## autoexec.cfg

This config is executed every time the game is loaded. Here you can find my aliases, binds, configuration options, spam, cheats, banter and other cool stuff.

## radiopanel.txt
Did you know there are some hidden radio commands in the game that you can use? Replace this file and they will appear in the radio menus. [See more info here.](http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=171993722)
